<h1>How to Read a Forge Dossier</h1>

<p class="dossier-lead">
This is not a review. Not an opinion. Not an invitation to agree. A Forge Dossier
is a structural incision - written to expose how something operates, not how it
feels, appears, or markets itself.

<div>
<h2>Suspend Taste</h2>
<p>
Do not ask whether you like the subject. Preference is irrelevant here. The Forge
does not evaluate pleasure, alignment, or identity. It evaluates load-bearing
capacity. If you read looking for affirmation, you will misread.

<div>
<h2>Read for Mechanism, Not Message</h2>
<p>The dossier maps forces, constraints, displacements, and roles. Ask:</p>

<ul>
<li>What behavior does this system produce?</li>
<li>What does it reward, tolerate, or punish?</li>
<li>Where does authority actually sit?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are searching for a point, you are already off-axis.</p>

<div>
<h2>Do Not Confuse Description with Endorsement</h2>
<p>
The Forge names how systems function - including ugly, predatory, or corrosive
ones. To describe a mechanism is not to justify it. Moral reflexes short-circuit
structural perception. Hold them back until the architecture is clear.

<div>
<h2>Assume Responsibility as a Reader</h2>
<p>
A Forge Dossier treats the reader as implicated, not external. You are not a
spectator. You are part of the ecosystem being described - as user, builder,
believer, consumer, or enabler.
</p>

<p>
If you feel attacked, locate the mechanism first. If you feel superior, locate
your insulation.

<h2>Read Linearly, Without Skimming</h2>
<p>
These texts are constructed under compression. Sections are cumulative. Skipping
is equivalent to removing a beam and judging the building unstable. If attention
fractures, stop reading. Return later.

<div>
<h2>Expect No Closure</h2>
<p>
A Forge Dossier does not resolve. It constrains. If you finish reading and feel
satisfied, something failed - either in the text or in your posture. The correct
residue is a restriction on how you can think or act going forward.

<div>
<h2>Do Not Ask "Is This True?" First</h2>
<p>Ask instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>If this were true, what would it force me to stop saying?</li>
<li>What practices would become indefensible?</li>
<li>What comforts would no longer survive?</li>
</ul>

<p>Truth in the Forge is operational, not rhetorical.</p>

<h3>Final Orientation</h3>

<p>
The Forge does not exist to curate culture. It exists to temper judgment. What
enters the dossier is not there to be admired or rejected lightly. It is there to
be held under heat until structure reveals itself.
</p>

<p>Read slowly. Read cleanly. Leave altered - or do not enter at all.</p>
