  <h1>THE FORGE — A Manifesto</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>We Do Not Curate. We Temper.</h2>
    <p>The Forge does not select what is fashionable — it reveals what is necessary. It is the flame beneath illusions, burning through nostalgia, performance, and pretense. What remains is essence. Structure. Truth with weight.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Beauty Must Survive Fire</h2>
    <p>Style without consequence is ash. The Forge only preserves beauty that carries burden. Ornament must serve soul. Every image, sound, or gesture must be a bearer of ethical or symbolic mass.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Emotion Is Not Evidence</h2>
    <p>The Forge respects feeling — but does not kneel to it. It asks: what structure caused the feeling? What architecture does the emotion stand on? If it collapses under scrutiny, it does not belong.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Forge Has No Audience</h2>
    <p>This is not a theatre. This is an anvil. We do not gather to be moved. We gather to be altered — structurally. A Forge-work leaves you with questions, scars, clarity, or confrontation. If all it offers is movement, it vanishes in the wind.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Fire Does Not Flatter</h2>
    <p>We do not celebrate creators. We do not worship pain. We extract what survives. The artist is not the center — the structure is. And the soul that enters is expected to bring presence, not performance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>This Is the Work</h2>
    <p>The Forge is not a platform. It is a crucible. You do not consume it — you enter it. And if you emerge, you do so changed.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="quote">“Flame does not ask who you are. It reveals what you are made of.”</div>
