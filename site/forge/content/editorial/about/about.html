  <h1>About the Forge</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>What Is the Forge?</h2>
    <p>The Forge is not a place of approval — it is a crucible. A testing ground for truth, where works of art, ideas, characters, and architectures of meaning are subjected to symbolic fire. That which survives is not praised — it is proven.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why the Forge Exists</h2>
    <p>In a world of noise, trends, and engineered impact, The Forge restores weight. It refuses comfort as criteria, trend as compass, or emotion as evidence. It seeks the structures that remain after the flame.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What the Forge Rejects</h2>
    <p>The Forge rejects mimicry. It does not serve aesthetics, nostalgia, or rebellion-for-show. It is not anti-mainstream — it is pre-mainstream. It burns through surface to reveal what is architecturally necessary to the soul.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Who May Enter the Forge?</h2>
    <p>Only that which confronts, dismantles, and rebuilds. That which leaves behind beauty, clarity, or scar. All else is cast into the Archive — cataloged, not condemned. Remember: the Forge does not hate. It separates.</p>
