SUBTITLE: Wishcraft Without Witness

This text is not Forge-canonical. It offers a certain kind of private relief, but relief is not the same as architecture.

❌ WHY THIS WORK DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It gives readers a sense of agency when life feels arbitrary or cruel.
- Its simplicity makes it easy to rehearse daily, like a ritual against helplessness.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure: it replaces tested structure with repetition and assertion, asking belief to do the work that reasoning should.
- ethical failure: it shifts responsibility for outcomes onto the individual in ways that can quietly blame the harmed for their harm.
- symbolic failure: it uses “universe” and “law” as props—symbols of inevitability—without paying the cost of explanation or constraint.

❌ Verdict:
Comforting, persuasive, and fundamentally unearned.

A doctrine that cannot be interrogated is not a key—it is a lullaby.
