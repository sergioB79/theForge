SUBTITLE: Velvet Hunger, Unbroken Glass

This book is widely read for a reason: it offers a controlled ache, a safe darkness, and a simple emotional thermostat. But the Forge is not a hall for cultural weather; it is a kiln for works whose language and structure change the reader’s internal geometry.

❌ WHY THIS WORK DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It externalizes adolescent longing into a clear, legible myth: desire as danger, attention as destiny.
- It creates a sustained mood of intimacy and suspense that keeps the reader steadily attached.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure — the architecture prioritizes propulsion and reassurance over friction; scenes function to maintain attachment, not to interrogate it.
- ethical failure — power imbalance is treated as atmosphere rather than examined pressure; the work leans on charisma where the Forge demands accountability.
- symbolic failure — the central symbols (predator, purity, immortality) remain decorative; they do not deepen into an earned system of meaning that wounds before it teaches.

❌ Verdict:
It entertains and comforts, but it does not metabolize its own darkness into irreversible insight.
