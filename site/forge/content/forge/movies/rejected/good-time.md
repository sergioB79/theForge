SUBTITLE: Velocity Without Transformation

This film has craft, nerve, and a controlled sense of descent—but Forge-canonical work must leave a moral or psychological structure behind once the adrenaline is removed. *Good Time* leaves an afterimage, not an architecture.

❌ WHY THIS FILM DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It compresses desperation into a single forward-motion engine, exposing how panic turns thinking into reflex.
- It sketches a recognizably modern moral numbness—people as obstacles, bodies as tools, time as an enemy.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- **Structural failure** — Its design is propulsion-first: consequence functions as escalation, not as revelation. Events pile up, but the inner logic does not deepen; it tightens.
- **Ethical failure** — Suffering becomes a currency to keep the machine moving. The film points at moral collapse, but it rarely forces moral clarity; it leverages harm more than it metabolizes it.
- **Symbolic failure** — Strip away performance, music, and momentum and the symbolic system thins: urgency stands in for meaning, and “survival at any cost” remains an aesthetic posture rather than a transformed insight.

❌ Verdict:
A precision-built panic device—impressive, unsustaining, and not reconstructive enough for the Forge.
