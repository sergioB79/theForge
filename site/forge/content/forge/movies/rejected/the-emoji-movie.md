SUBTITLE: Candy-Colored Noise Over an Empty Core

This film is not Forge-canonical. It is competent at generating motion and appealing surfaces, but when the performance, music, and novelty are removed, there is no enduring structure left to test, refine, or carry forward.

❌ WHY THIS FILM DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It gestures toward a modern anxiety: identity under a system that demands fixed roles and readable signals.
- It borrows the language of inner conflict (performing a self vs. being a self) and places it inside a world built from shared symbols.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure — Its world is an advertising interface masquerading as mythology; the rules serve brand-recognition and constant stimulus, not a coherent symbolic order that can survive without style.
- ethical failure — The film flirts with self-acceptance as a slogan rather than a consequence; change is framed as permission granted by the system, not a hard-won moral reorientation.
- symbolic failure — “Expression” is reduced to consumer-friendly icons; once you strip away the cute design language, the symbols do not deepen into archetype, paradox, or residue—only a thin metaphor for conformity remains.

❌ Verdict:
A loud container with no lasting substance; it does not withstand the Forge.
