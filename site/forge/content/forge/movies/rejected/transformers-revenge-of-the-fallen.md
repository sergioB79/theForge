SUBTITLE: Noise as a Substitute for Meaning

This film is not Forge-canonical. Whatever craft exists here is deployed toward saturation rather than revelation, and what remains after the volume is removed is not a structure—only an impulse.

❌ WHY THIS FILM DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It gestures toward mythic scale—ancient beings, origin stories, fate-and-cosmos language—inviting the expectation of symbolic weight.
- It delivers technical spectacle with relentless momentum, which can mimic “importance” through sheer sensory authority.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- **Structural failure** — Escalation replaces architecture. Set-pieces accumulate without forming an ethical or psychological progression; intensity becomes the organizing principle, not meaning.
- **Ethical failure** — Emotion is used as a lever, not as consequence. Stakes are declared externally (end-of-world rhetoric) rather than earned through interior change or morally binding choice.
- **Symbolic failure** — The mythic vocabulary (gods, relics, destiny, sacrifice) is ornamental. Strip away sound, scale, and comedic abrasion, and the symbols do not resolve into a coherent claim about power, identity, or responsibility.

❌ Verdict:
It entertains by impact, but it does not refine the viewer—so it cannot enter the Forge.

When volume becomes the thesis, nothing true survives the silence.
