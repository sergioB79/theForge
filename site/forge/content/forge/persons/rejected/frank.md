SUBTITLE: A name without a wound, a silhouette waiting for consequence


INFO:
A surface-level everyman, useful as a vessel but lacking decisive, irreversible structure.
Carries implied ethics of honesty without a single binding choice to test them.
Operates as placeholder identity: strong image, weak architecture, no locked sequence of consequence.
Ultimately an outline archived for reference, not a forged person to stand as warning.

This record is not Forge-canonical. “Frank” arrives as a surface—recognizable, usable, and empty enough to accept projection—but the Forge does not burn projections. It burns structure.

❌ WHY THIS FIGURE DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- The plainness invites symbolism: an everyman vessel for failure, compromise, and quiet harm.
- The name carries an implied ethic (“frankness”) that suggests a test between honesty and self-protection.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure: no defined irreversible error, no fixed sequence of loss → revelation → consequence to lock the figure into shape.
- ethical failure: without a specific choice that cannot be undone, there is no accountability—only mood and implication.
- symbolic failure: the image is stronger than the architecture; “Frank” functions as a placeholder rather than a warning with teeth.

❌ Verdict:
A useful outline, not a forged person.
