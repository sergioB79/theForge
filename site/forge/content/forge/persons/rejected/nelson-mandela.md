SUBTITLE: Prison-tempered reconciler turned national mirror

This entry is not Forge-canonical. It is treated here with respect, but the Forge is not a hall for the universally affirmed; it is an anvil for unresolved consequence and the shapes it leaves behind.

❌ WHY THIS FIGURE DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- a life forced through confinement, fracture, and irreversible time-loss
- a public ethic that tested whether mercy can be made into statecraft

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure: the dominant reading resolves him into a singular emblem, flattening the architecture of compromise, coercion, and contingency into “moral victory”
- ethical failure: the story is too often permitted to end cleanly—reconciliation as closure—when the Forge requires a wound that cannot be narratively sutured
- symbolic failure: his image outmuscles his structure; he is celebrated as proof of a possibility more than examined as a warning about what reconciliation costs and what it cannot repair

❌ Verdict:
Too canonized to remain dangerous.
