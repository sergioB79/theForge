SUBTITLE: Manufactured havoc in a ring-shaped spotlight

He may be consequential in the marketplace of attention, but this record is not Forge-canonical; the Forge does not anoint relevance, it tests what remains when performance stops working.

❌ WHY THIS FIGURE DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- He demonstrates how spectacle can be converted into leverage, money, and legitimacy.
- He provokes real reactions—envy, contempt, fascination—revealing the audience’s hunger for conflict-as-content.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure: The persona is modular and self-editing; consequence is managed, rebranded, and routed into the next cycle rather than endured.
- ethical failure: Harm is treated as a growth strategy, not a cost that restructures the self; accountability is negotiable and often externalized.
- symbolic failure: The image is stronger than the interior architecture—more campaign than character, more algorithm than scar.

❌ Verdict:
A loud signal with insufficient irreversible weight.
