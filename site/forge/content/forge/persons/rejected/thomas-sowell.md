SUBTITLE: Economist of hard edges, polishing certainty into policy


INFO:
Assessed here as a shaper of rhetoric and justification, not a forged self.
His signature rigor about tradeoffs and constraints redirects suffering into arguments for restraint.
The persona of hard-nosed empiricist resists narrative fracture, arriving armored rather than endangered.
Influence accumulates, but the life does not register irreversible inner damage as visible structure.

This entry is not Forge-canonical. It can be studied with seriousness, but it does not survive the Forge’s requirement of irreversible consequence as structure rather than influence.

❌ WHY THIS FIGURE DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- A disciplined moral architecture: tradeoffs, constraints, and unintended consequences held up as the adult language of politics.
- A body of arguments that scar institutions indirectly—shaping how readers justify austerity, responsibility, and skepticism of grand plans.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure: the central drama is intellectual consistency, not a passage through loss that permanently alters the self in a way the work cannot out-argue.
- ethical failure: the posture often functions as insulation—suffering becomes evidence for restraint rather than a demand for moral risk, keeping the author largely unexposed to the cost of his prescriptions.
- symbolic failure: the image (plainspoken rigor, “facts over feelings”) outmuscles the interior fracture; the persona arrives already armored, leaving too little transformation to examine.

❌ Verdict:
An engine of arguments, not a figure forged by irreparable consequence.
