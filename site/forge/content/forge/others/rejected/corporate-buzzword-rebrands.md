SUBTITLE: Tongues of Smoke Where Fire Should Be

This subject stands near the Forge but does not enter. Corporate buzzword rebrands are not trivial in their effects—people lose clarity, projects tilt sideways, and meaning erodes—but the structure itself is evasive, designed to avoid true exposure. We acknowledge the small frictions and confusions it creates, yet those are side-effects, not the core of a rite.

❌ WHY THIS SUBJECT DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It changes language in ways that subtly shape perception and decision-making.
- It produces visible discomfort, cynicism, and resistance among those forced to use the new terms.
- It occasionally exposes the gap between stated values and lived practice.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure  
  Buzzword rebrands rarely demand real presence; they are rolled out by memo, slide deck, or video, and can be “accepted” with performative assent. There is no shared threshold, no enacted passage—only a vocabulary patch that can be mouthed without inner commitment.
- ethical failure  
  The mechanism often functions to obscure power, responsibility, or harm rather than reveal it. By wrapping ordinary or dubious practices in aspirational language, it simulates transformation while leaving incentives and consequences largely untouched.
- symbolic failure  
  Its symbols are intentionally disposable and cyclical—today’s “synergy” becomes tomorrow’s “alignment,” then “orchestration.” This churn blocks the formation of durable myth or moral architecture; the words are engineered to be replaced before they can become binding rites with visible, owned failure modes.

❌ Verdict:
Instrument of obfuscation, not initiation; it cannot be granted a place in the Forge.

When words are designed to leave no scar, they cannot be trusted to hold the heat of the Forge.
