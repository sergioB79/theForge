SUBTITLE: Fever Without Witness


INFO:
Examines crypto booms as attention-weather, not a canonically transformative Forge ordeal.
Shows how fortunes, reputations, and perceptions mutate under market pressure and collective delusion.
Argues these cycles lack presence, responsibility, and binding symbolic structure required for real rites.
Concludes crypto spectacle injures and reshapes people, yet rarely clarifies or commits them to repair.

Crypto hype cycles look like ordeal from a distance: people gather, speak in omens, risk money, and emerge changed. But this is not Forge-canonical. It is a weather system of attention—loud, contagious, and rarely owned by anyone present enough to be accountable.

❌ WHY THIS SUBJECT DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It produces visible consequences: fortunes shift, reputations burn, relationships strain, and naïveté becomes scar tissue.
- It alters perception under pressure: certainty masquerades as insight, and crowds rewrite what “truth” feels like in real time.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure: It does not require presence—participation can be automated, outsourced, memed, or passively absorbed; the “rite” continues without the practitioner.
- ethical failure: Incentives reward projection over responsibility; gains are often coupled to someone else’s confusion, and the system does not bind the participant to repair what they distort.
- symbolic failure: Its failure modes are noisy but not clarifying; collapse teaches randomness as much as it teaches restraint, and the meaning is retrofitted after the fact.

❌ Verdict:
A spectacle that can injure you is not automatically a rite that can shape you.
