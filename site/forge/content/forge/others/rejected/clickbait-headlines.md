SUBTITLE: Bait Without Blood

Clickbait headlines know the doorways of the mind and how to lean on them. They do not ask for your presence; they steal it, then vanish before you can notice what was taken. This is not Forge-canonical, because the heat they generate is borrowed and the cost is paid somewhere offstage.

❌ WHY THIS SUBJECT DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It exposes a real battleground: attention, impulse, and the hunger to know.
- It can change behavior quickly, training reflexes toward curiosity and outrage.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure: it creates a spike, not a rite—no sustained practice, no enduring container that demands return.
- ethical failure: it profits from asymmetry, manipulating expectation while hiding consequence behind the next click.
- symbolic failure: its “failure” is invisible—misdirection, distortion, and numbness accumulate quietly, without a clear moment of reckoning.

❌ Verdict:
It simulates the edge of consequence while ensuring no one has to stand in it.

A culture that learns to bait itself forgets how to tell the truth without a hook.
