SUBTITLE: Bait Without Blood


INFO:
Explores clickbait as an attention hack that generates heat without building lasting practice.
Contrasts rapid behavioral shifts with absence of a sustaining container or repeatable rite.
Details structural, ethical, and symbolic failures rooted in asymmetry and hidden consequences.
Argues clickbait simulates stakes while carefully avoiding real moments of personal reckoning.

Clickbait headlines know the doorways of the mind and how to lean on them. They do not ask for your presence; they steal it, then vanish before you can notice what was taken. This is not Forge-canonical, because the heat they generate is borrowed and the cost is paid somewhere offstage.

❌ WHY THIS SUBJECT DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It exposes a real battleground: attention, impulse, and the hunger to know.
- It can change behavior quickly, training reflexes toward curiosity and outrage.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure: it creates a spike, not a rite—no sustained practice, no enduring container that demands return.
- ethical failure: it profits from asymmetry, manipulating expectation while hiding consequence behind the next click.
- symbolic failure: its “failure” is invisible—misdirection, distortion, and numbness accumulate quietly, without a clear moment of reckoning.

❌ Verdict:
It simulates the edge of consequence while ensuring no one has to stand in it.

A culture that learns to bait itself forgets how to tell the truth without a hook.
