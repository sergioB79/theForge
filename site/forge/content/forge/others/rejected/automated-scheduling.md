SUBTITLE: Friction Removed, Meaning Thinned

Automated scheduling promises relief from the small violences of coordination. It can feel like a civilizing layer over chaos—fewer messages, fewer misunderstandings, fewer delays. But it does not enter the Forge as a rite; it enters as an optimization.

❌ WHY THIS SUBJECT DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It reduces waste and restores attention by clearing logistical noise.
- It forces explicitness: availability becomes declared, boundaries become legible.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure: Its “presence” is outsourced; the system does the confronting, the negotiating, and the remembering, leaving the user untouched.
- ethical failure: It can simulate respect while quietly privileging the calibrated and the powerful—those with flexible calendars, clean time blocks, and institutional leverage.
- symbolic failure: It removes the visible cost of saying yes and no, thinning the meaning of commitment into slots, links, and auto-accepts.

❌ Verdict:
A useful engine, not a consecration—kept outside the Forge.
