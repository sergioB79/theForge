SUBTITLE: Mirrors That Answer to Payroll

Performance reviews are an old chamber in modern organizations: a scheduled confrontation with judgment, language, and power. They can bruise or clarify, and they often decide who eats, who advances, and who disappears. But the Forge does not take what merely matters; it takes what transforms through visible consequence and demanded presence.

❌ WHY THIS SUBJECT DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It is a formalized moment where identity is negotiated under authority, and words can rewire self-perception.
- It carries real stakes—pay, status, access—so it masquerades as consequence-bearing discipline.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure: The rite is not intrinsic; it is an administrative wrapper that varies wildly by manager, template, and corporate mood, collapsing into paperwork when the room lacks courage.
- ethical failure: The power imbalance encourages performance over truth—people learn to manage impressions, hoard credit, and speak safely, meaning “discipline” is simulated rather than lived.
- symbolic failure: The failure modes are frequently invisible or deniable (bias, favoritism, shifting goals, unspoken politics), so the system can harm without leaving an accountable scar.

❌ Verdict:
It is a managerial instrument with ritual clothing, not a rite that reliably alters the one who enters it.
