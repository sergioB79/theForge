SUBTITLE: Time Offered to Nobody

Mandatory endless meetings are real, and their gravity is not imagined—but what they generate is mostly exhaust. They can scar attention, flatten initiative, and teach people to survive by withholding themselves. Still, this is not Forge-canonical material.

❌ WHY THIS SUBJECT DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It requires presence in the most literal sense: bodies and minutes are seized and cannot be reclaimed.
- Its failure modes are visible: fatigue, cynicism, stalled work, and the quiet drift of competent people.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure — It creates occupancy, not a rite; repetition substitutes for meaning, and the “discipline” is only compliance with scheduling.
- ethical failure — It trains self-erasure and risk-avoidance, rewarding the performance of engagement over accountable choice and clear consequence.
- symbolic failure — Its central symbol is noise posing as coordination; it alters perception by blurring signal, not by sharpening vow, limit, or truth.

❌ Verdict:
This is coercive theater, not a forgeable practice.

A room full of voices is not proof that anything is being made.
