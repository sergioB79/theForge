SUBTITLE: Silver Algorithms over a Rusted World

This sits at the edge of rite but never quite crosses over. “AI will save us” is a collective comfort story: it soothes anxiety about collapse by outsourcing agency to an abstract machine future. People repeat it in boardrooms, headlines, and conference keynotes, but its risks and failures rarely land on the speaker’s own body. The narrative moves crowds, yet it does not demand that anyone actually stay present with consequence. As it stands, it is signal without sufficient cost.

❌ WHY THIS SUBJECT DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It channels genuine fear about ecological, economic, and social breakdown into a shared myth of rescue.
- It alters how institutions allocate power and resources, subtly reshaping what forms of human responsibility are considered necessary or optional.
- It reveals a deep spiritual hunger in secular language: a longing for providence disguised as progress.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure  
  The narrative functions comfortably under idealized assumptions: scalable alignment, benevolent governance, smooth deployment. Its mechanics collapse when confronted with non-ideal conditions—corrupt incentives, infrastructural fragility, contested values. It is a story optimized for slides, not for storms. There is no built‑in rite of reckoning when outcomes deviate from the fantasy; blame disperses, no one stands in the circle.
- ethical failure  
  Responsibility is displaced upward and outward to a future system rather than downward and inward to present actors. The myth invites passivity: “wait for the upgrade,” “the model will optimize this,” “once we automate, it will be fair.” This is simulated discipline—strategy decks, ethical principles, task forces—without a matching willingness to bear real, personal cost when things go wrong. Consequence is externalized to those with less power and less voice.
- symbolic failure  
  Forge rites require presence and visible failure. “AI will save us” is architected to keep failure abstract: when systems harm, the story mutates (“not this AI, the next one”) instead of cracking. It is self-healing propaganda, not a vessel for truth. Symbolically, it recasts an engineering paradigm as destiny, leaving no space for mourning, refusal, or renunciation. The narrative does not invite people to stand in their own finite agency; it invites them to spectate a promised inevitability.

❌ Verdict:
A salvation story that dissolves accountability cannot be hammered into a rite.

When we name the machine our savior, we rehearse surrender and call it progress.
