SUBTITLE: Mirrors That Never Touch the World

Optimization-for-optimization loops carry a familiar heat: the promise that refinement itself is virtue. But the Forge does not canonize motion that cannot bear weight, and this subject too often turns inward until presence is replaced by metrics about metrics.

❌ WHY THIS SUBJECT DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It mimics austerity and rigor, offering a clear axis of “better” that can feel like discipline.
- It can produce occasional breakthroughs when a real constraint finally forces the loop to confront reality.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure — It does not reliably create a rite; it creates recurrence without a threshold, an infinite corridor with no gate.
- ethical failure — It rewards self-justification and displacement: effort becomes evidence, and absence of outcome is reframed as “still optimizing.”
- symbolic failure — Its failure modes are often invisible or deniable; the loop can persist without ever being forced to admit it is not changing behavior, only describing it more finely.

❌ Verdict:
A closed circuit is not a furnace.
