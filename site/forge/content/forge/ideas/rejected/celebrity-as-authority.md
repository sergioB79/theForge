SUBTITLE: Borrowed Light, Empty Weight

This notion arrives loud and already agreed upon by a certain kind of fatigue. It names something real, but it does not build a usable frame for living—only a glare to look at.

❌ WHY THIS IDEA DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It captures a modern distortion: visibility being mistaken for competence or moral standing.
- It offers an immediate villain, making social confusion feel legible and explainable.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure — it is mostly a diagnosis, not an architecture; it cannot guide action beyond cynicism or withdrawal.
- ethical failure — it flattens responsibility into contempt for “the masses” or “the famous,” rewarding superiority instead of cultivating discernment.
- symbolic failure — it depends on the same attention-economy it condemns; when the names change, the critique resets rather than deepens.

❌ Verdict:
A sharp complaint that does not survive silence—useful as a headline, not as a compass.
