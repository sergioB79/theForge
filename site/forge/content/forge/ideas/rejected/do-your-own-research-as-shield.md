SUBTITLE: The Labyrinth Used as Armor

This phrase arrives wearing the costume of rigor, but it is usually deployed as a barricade—an exit door from responsibility, clarity, and shared standards of truth. It may begin in good faith. In practice, it rarely survives contact with real stakes.

❌ WHY THIS IDEA DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It gestures at intellectual autonomy, resisting passive consumption and institutional capture.
- It sounds like discipline: verify, cross-check, don’t outsource your mind.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure: It substitutes a task for a method—“research” becomes an infinite horizon with no criteria for sufficiency, relevance, or falsification.
- ethical failure: It shifts the burden of proof away from the claimant, turning conversation into a refusal to be accountable for assertions.
- symbolic failure: It becomes a status charm—signaling independence while quietly protecting a conclusion from contact, correction, and consequence.

❌ Verdict:
Not a tool for truth—an alibi for insisting without answering.

A mind that demands others “research” what it won’t defend has already chosen shelter over reality.
