SUBTITLE: The Throne Built From Bare Hands

This idea is not Forge-canonical. It has the hard shine of inevitability, and it often arrives wearing the mask of realism. But realism that refuses responsibility is only a shortcut dressed as clarity.

❌ WHY THIS IDEA DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It survives silence because it matches what people can observe in unprotected spaces: force often wins.
- It resists naïve moralizing by insisting that outcomes, not intentions, govern history.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure — it collapses “can” into “ought,” turning a description of leverage into a justification of domination.
- ethical failure — it authorizes cruelty as competence and treats the vulnerable as evidence of their own illegitimacy.
- symbolic failure — it reduces the human world to a single metric (power), erasing duty, restraint, reciprocity, and the moral cost that makes authority more than occupation.

❌ Verdict:
It explains conquest, but it cannot build a world worth inhabiting.

A world that calls strength “right” has already surrendered its right to be strong.
