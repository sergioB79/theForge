SUBTITLE: Brass Noise, Paper Strength

This is not Forge-canonical. It has heat, motion, and a certain rugged poetry—but when you stop feeding it attention, it does not stand on its own weight.

❌ WHY THIS IDEA DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It offers an immediate ethic for drifting lives: work as direction, effort as identity.
- It produces visible outputs fast, which masquerades as proof of inner worth.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure — It cannot survive silence; without external metrics, it collapses into anxiety-management and performance.
- ethical failure — It converts human value into throughput, rewarding neglect of body, relationship, and civic duty as if they were impurities.
- symbolic failure — It mistakes velocity for meaning and strain for nobility; the symbol is the treadmill, not the path.

❌ Verdict:
A loud substitute for purpose that dissolves the moment life demands stillness.

Work can be sacred, but a life that must keep sprinting to deserve itself is already condemned.
