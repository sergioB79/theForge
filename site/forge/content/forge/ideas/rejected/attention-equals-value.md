SUBTITLE: The Coin Made of Eyes


INFO:
Explores why treating attention as a single currency distorts ethics, meaning, and value.
Shows how click-optimized systems reward spectacle, outrage, and visibility over care or truth.
Argues that collapsing diverse attentional states into one metric erases their moral differences.
Critiques this slogan as diagnosis without practice, offering no resilient way to steward attention.

Attention Equals Value is a useful alarm bell, but it is not Forge-canonical. It points sharply at a real distortion, yet it cannot bear long silence without turning into a slogan.

❌ WHY THIS IDEA DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It names a visible force shaping institutions, relationships, media, and selfhood: what gets noticed gets funded, promoted, and repeated.
- It offers immediate leverage for skepticism: distrust what is optimized for clicks, spectacle, and outrage.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure — It collapses under simplification because it *is* the simplification: attention is treated as a single currency when it is actually multiple kinds (care, vigilance, curiosity, obsession) with different moral weights and outcomes.
- ethical failure — It quietly confuses popularity with legitimacy, even when used to critique popularity; it cannot reliably tell you what deserves devotion, only what is successfully engineered to capture it.
- symbolic failure — It reconstructs very little: it diagnoses a market dynamic but offers no stable inner practice for choosing, holding, or sanctifying attention when incentives are hostile.

❌ Verdict:
A sharp critique disguised as a law of reality.
