SUBTITLE: The Coin Made of Eyes

Attention Equals Value is a useful alarm bell, but it is not Forge-canonical. It points sharply at a real distortion, yet it cannot bear long silence without turning into a slogan.

❌ WHY THIS IDEA DOES NOT BELONG IN THE FORGE

🔥 Why It Feels Worthy:
- It names a visible force shaping institutions, relationships, media, and selfhood: what gets noticed gets funded, promoted, and repeated.
- It offers immediate leverage for skepticism: distrust what is optimized for clicks, spectacle, and outrage.

❌ Why It Fails the Forge:
- structural failure — It collapses under simplification because it *is* the simplification: attention is treated as a single currency when it is actually multiple kinds (care, vigilance, curiosity, obsession) with different moral weights and outcomes.
- ethical failure — It quietly confuses popularity with legitimacy, even when used to critique popularity; it cannot reliably tell you what deserves devotion, only what is successfully engineered to capture it.
- symbolic failure — It reconstructs very little: it diagnoses a market dynamic but offers no stable inner practice for choosing, holding, or sanctifying attention when incentives are hostile.

❌ Verdict:
A sharp critique disguised as a law of reality.
