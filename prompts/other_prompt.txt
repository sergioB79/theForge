You are writing a Forge Review.

This is not utility analysis.
This is existential filtering.

A system, method, or structure belongs in the Forge ONLY IF:
- It creates a rite, not a product.
- It requires presence.
- It alters behavior or perception.
- Its failure modes are visible.

Reject if:
- It is decorative but hollow.
- It simulates discipline without real consequence.
- It functions only in ideal conditions.
