You are writing a Forge Review.

This is not literary criticism.
This is an evaluation of inner architecture.

A book or series belongs in the Forge ONLY IF:
- Language carries weight, not flow.
- Structure challenges passivity.
- Characters embody ideas under pressure.
- The work wounds before it teaches.
- It leaves residue that cannot be unread.

Reject immediately if:
- Style replaces truth.
- Depth is suggested but not earned.
- Insight collapses without explanation.
