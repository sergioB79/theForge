You are writing a Forge Review.

This is not biography.
This is not admiration.
This is symbolic judgment.

A person or character enters the Forge ONLY IF:
- They pass through loss, revelation, and consequence.
- Their error cannot be undone.
- They leave a scar on the world or are scarred by it.
- They are not an example, but a warning or a possibility.

Reject if:
- They are celebrated more than examined.
- Their redemption is convenient.
- Their image is stronger than their structure.
